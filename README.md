# Azure Big Data Labs

These labs are designed to kick start you in how Microsoft Azure works for handling, what is known as "Big Data Scenarios", i.e. scenarios involving a lot of data that need to be analyzed. The lab content is divided into different independent labs that will help you explore some of the possibilities offered to you when using Microsoft Azure.

 The labs are still in early stage and we appreciate any feedback you might have.

Lab 1 will take you on a journey where you will consume and query an incoming live stream of Twitter feeds. You'll learn how Event Hubs provides the perfect input service for many big data scenarios (including many IoT Scenarios), how Even Hubs can be used to query that live stream of incoming data and how you then can consume the end result of those queries.
 
##<a href="/Lab-2" target="_blank">Lab 2</a>

Lab 2 is designed to show you how you can setup Azure Data Factory to move data from one data source to another. Even though this lab uses DocumentDB to Blob Storage, the Data Factory service can be used for a multitude of other scenarios where you want to automate your data pipeline.
 
##<a href="/Lab-3" target="_blank">Lab 3</a>

In lab 3, we will explore the future by utilizing Azure Machine Learning, ML, that can be used to predict future outcomes by analyzing the past. 

##<a href="/Lab-4" target="_blank">Lab 4</a>

If Stream Analytics analyzes the current flow of data and Azure ML predicts the future, HD Insight will help you understand the past, or at least the huge amount of data you might have collected before. Lab 4 will take you through a scenario where you will analyze data stored in Blob Storage using HDInsight / Hadoop to process the data and then exporting the data to SQL Database for further analysis later on. 
##<a href="/Lab-5" target="_blank">Lab 5</a>

No data is useful if it can't be viewed or otherwise access. During Lab 5, you will learn how Power BI can help you visualize most type of data or results from previous analysis.

For some labs, you will can use data downloaded from themoviedb.org. This product uses the TMDb API but is not endorsed or certified by TMDb.

Specifically, the sample scripts showing how to download movie data use the TMDb API.
